# Testing Core Web Vitals

This repo includes basic tests to see how well Lighthouse measures Core Web Vitals.

Specifically, I'm looking for buggy behaviorâ€”situations where Lighthouse reports something unexpected for FCP, CLS, etc.

## Running Tests

I've added [`http-server`](https://github.com/http-party/http-server#readme) to load the test pages locally, and a rough `npm test` command to quickly batch-run Lighthouse tests.

```sh
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

Open the HTML files in the `lighthouse/` folder to see the reports.

By default, `npm test` only checks the FCP Opacity test. To test other pages, edit the `test` script in `package.json` and change the paths to the page you want to test. (I'll improve this soon.)
